# Environment variables

The configuration file makes use of various environment variables.
SkyBright Applicatin has a default prefix `SKY`

Most of the environment variables must be defined for various configurations, which are distinguished by different infixes for the variable name:

| Configuration name | Infix |
| --- | --- |
| development | `DEV_` |
| testing | `TEST_` |
| production | no infix |



The script `run_tests.sh` uses the testing configuration. Code deployed to a remote server uses the production configuration. Otherwise the configuration specified by the `FLASK_APP_CONFIG` environment variable.


**Example** Taking the first first variable `DATABASE_URI`. Then `SKY_DEV_DATABASE_URI`, `SKY_TEST_DATABASE_URI` and `SKY_DATABASE_URI`
variables must be defined on the development machine

The following variables are required for all three modes with prefix `SKY`:

| Environment variable | Description | Required | Default | Example |
