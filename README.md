# Flask Start Setup

A simple framework for getting started with a Flask site using a MySQL database, which is based on the books *Flask Web Development* by Miguel Grinberg (O'Reilly) and *Mastering Flask* by Jack Stouffer (Packt Publishing).

The framework will launch a Bokeh server on your deployment host. See the section on Bokeh to find out what to do if you don't need this.
